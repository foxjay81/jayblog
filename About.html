I am the Product Enablement Leader at Lifion, a startup with ADP. 

<p>We are building Human Capital Management software from the ground up and I am on the Go-to-Market team that's bringing in our first wave of intrepid clients. </p>

<p>Prior to ADP I was the Director of Product Development at TheStreet, a digital media, information and data analytics company. I built web, mobile, web services/APIs, and email products that reached tens of thousands of paying clients. I led an agile development team of engineers and QA managers. 
</p>

<p>Before The Deal I was part of a group that built the U.S. business for a global fund of funds called The Permal Group. I was also in telecom equity research at Citigroup where I cut my teeth on financial modeling and geeked out on Excel. I still love a good spreadsheet! </p>

<p>I’m always interested in hearing from former colleagues or just like-minded product owners and product managers, so feel free to contact me if you’d like to connect. </p>

<p>I live in Jersey City, NJ with my wife, son, and dog. I am an avid outdoorsman and love biking and fly-fishing. But I'm normally found just chasing my son or dog around most weekends. </p>
